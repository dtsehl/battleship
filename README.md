# Battleship

Battleship is a paired project [Dan Sehl](https://www.github.com/dtsehl) and [Cam Cherry](https://www.github.com/ckccameron) did in Module 1 of Turing School of Software and Design's Back End Engineering program. This was coded over roughly two weeks in the Ruby programming language which they had both only begun to learn a week prior to beginning the project.

### About this Project

This project emulates the board game Battleship where a user can place ships, fire upon and play against an AI opponent. It's run on a 4x4 grid and there are two ship types of varying length: the Cruiser which has a length of 3, and a Submarine which has a length of 2.

The player and AI take turns firing upon the board of the others until one player's ships are sunk, at which point the player can opt to quit the game or play another round.
